### 0.1.1
* Added demo.gif to readme

### 0.1.2
* Added snippet for new checkbox markup
* Added snippet for new radio button markup

With the release of govuk-elements-sass 3.0, the markup on the radio buttons 
and checkboxes changed. For now, both versions are now available as snippets and 
suffixed with [OLD] or [NEW]. The old ones will be removed in a future update.
